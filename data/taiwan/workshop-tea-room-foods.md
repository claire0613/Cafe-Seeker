    It seems most cafes focus on coffee, however, this place is perfect for someone who appreciates tea. The selection is great, with many types of black, green, and herbal/fruit tea. Each tea comes with a detailed description, so you can easily spend some time deciding what you want to try. The tea set is proper and even comes with a tea brewing timer so you can brew your perfect cup. The staff will also come around offering to refill your tea with more hot water as needed.

    The interior is feels spacious and bright, with high ceilings and large windows across two floors. The first floor is great for eating and socializing. However, if you prefer a quiet spot to yourself then you can go upstairs and sit by the large windows and enjoy the atmosphere.

    For working, the background music was to my taste (a mix of lounge and electronic). The WiFi is definitely slow, but it was stable and worked during my entire stay. Also, most tables don't have access to power outlets, but at least the large work table does. It was quite noisy around lunch time, but the rest of the afternoon was very pleasant.

    感覺上大部分的Cafe都主打咖啡，或說咖啡的能見度比較高，(中文裡大家往往會把Cafe直譯為咖啡店，但Cafe可能也包含喫茶店、輕食)，但Workshop是一家對茶飲愛好者更為友善的Cafe。在這裡你可以找到各式紅、綠茶，以及香草茶及水果茶等等，每種茶式都有詳細的介紹，所以不妨花點時間研究要點什麼茶。Workshop的茶組還有提供一個沙漏，方便大家沖出一杯最適合自己的茶，如有需要，店員也會時常到座位旁幫忙加熱水。

    整個Workshop的空間非常寬敞明亮，挑高的天花板和延伸兩層樓的大面落地窗提供了非常豐沛的光源，一樓很適合聊天及用餐，上到二樓則能享受一樣漂亮的採光，在更加安靜舒適的環境下工作，背景音樂也多半很符合我的胃口(一些Lounge音樂和電子樂)，很適合需要專注思考的工作類型。WiFi稍嫌慢，不過算是很穩定，只是大部分的座位都沒有插座，只有中間的大工作桌有一些，另外是中午時間可能比較擁擠吵雜，但多數下午時間氣氛很宜人。
