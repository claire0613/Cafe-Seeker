    During a trip to Kaohsiung I asked a friend for cafe recommendations. This was the first one he recommended, and it was definitely a great choice. The space is very large, feels modern and bright, with lots of natural light. There are plenty of seating options, and I especially liked the large worktables and the individual counter seats in the back (popular for working or studying).

    The menu is quite cheap, and has both food and drink, so it's definitely suitable for a working brunch/lunch. I tried the bacon & peanut butter toast, which was quite good.

    The WiFi was fast, there were plenty of power outlets. If I was living in Kaohsiung this would definitely be a regular spot!

    在高雄旅行的時候，我尋求朋友的推薦找到了「咖啡覺醒」，這是朋友第一個推薦的好店，實際體驗也發現所言非虛，這是一個非常好的選擇。咖啡覺醒的空間非常大，整體給人明亮時尚的感覺，有非常多的自然光線透進來。一如往常的，我非常熱愛大型工作桌，和在後頭的獨立吧檯型座位，最能讓人專心，除此之外他們也有很多種座位可以選，適合各種不同的用途。

    餐點價格算是非常便宜，同時也有供餐所以也是一個很好的早午餐場所，我點了培根和花生醬吐司，味道非常好！

    這裡的Wifi非常快，也有很多插座，如果我住在高雄的話，應該會非常常來這裡。
