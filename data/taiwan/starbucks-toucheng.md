    Recently I took a day trip from Taipei to Toucheng. My main goal was to visit the new Starbucks there. It’s only a few minutes walk from Toucheng station, so it’s quite convenient to access. The outside is very interesting (designed to look like a cruise ship) and the inside feels large and spacious. The second floor features panoramic windows, giving you a nice view of the surrounding area, and letting in a lot of natural light.

    At first it seemed like a great place to work from. Very fast WiFi, power outlets, and lots of seating options. The early morning time was nice and quiet. However, even on a weekday, it got very crowded and busy towards mid-day. Lots of people were coming in to have a look and take photos. There were even 3 full tour busses parked outside, seemingly using the Starbucks as a coffee and bathroom break. The noise level got so loud that we decided it was time to pack up and go for lunch.

    Overall, a fun place to visit and take some photos, but unfortunately it’s probably still too new to actually be a useful place to work from.

    最近我安排了一個頭城小旅行，主要目的是探訪新開的船型星巴克。頭城星巴克距離火車站只有短短幾分鐘距離，非常容易前往。外觀設計非常有趣，是船體的造型，和海洋相呼應，內部則非常寬敞，二樓有大面積的窗戶，讓人飽覽景色，也帶進許多陽光。

    一開始我覺得這裡真是適合工作，WiFi很快、有很多插座和座位，一大早剛開門時氣氛非常清幽。很可惜的是，即使是平日，人潮還是在將近中午時間快速湧現，很多遊客專程來拍照參觀，甚至有三台滿載的遊覽車排隊等候進場；他們把這家星巴克當成旅程間的休息站，吵雜的聲音逼得我們落荒而逃，順勢找別處享用午餐。

    整體來說這裡是個IG拍照的好去處，不過也許還太新，在嘗新的群眾退去以前，恐怕沒辦法成為一個真正實用的工作型Cafe。
