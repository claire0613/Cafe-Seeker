For those who don’t have an office, it’s a blessing to find a great location in a coffee shop, especially in such a cute little shop. People who have followed Cafe & Cowork for a while may have realized that I usually like to recommend cafes that are easier to reach, but if you are from Taiwan's main island like us, you must first get on a plane to visit Woo Life. I mean, why not? :)

Take the bus directly from the airport to the Shanwai Bus Station, and the cafe is right beside it. Or by car, you can park in the parking lot in front of the bus station.

I have a deep impression of Woo Life, as soon as I open the door, I know that today is the right time. The music is quiet, the light is full, and the seats facing a row of books is very appealing. There is also a large work table, so you can immediately imagine working here; and who doesn’t like the countertop in front of the large glass windows? I love to take a glance outside for a moment.

You already know the disadvantages, it's small and it's hard not to fill up such a good place. But if you have a week of traveling around Kinmen, Woo Life would be a good choice, so come early.

The coffee and desserts are excellent, good Wifi, and a few sockets (that's the lucky seat :))

"An outsider will probably know that Kinmen is also known as *Woo Island (浯島)* and while staying on this small island, they once drank an unforgettable coffee." - Woo Life

This is indeed the case.
