    There are several Dreamers Coffee locations in Taipei, but this one near Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall is my favorite. They open at 7 every day, so it's a great place to work in the mornings, especially since it usually gets very busy after lunch. Good natural light thanks to the large windows all around. The large worktable (with power outlets) is great to work from. There are also power outlets by all the smaller tables. The WiFi works for basic browsing, but it's not super fast. Cheap drinks, but tea selection is slightly lacking in my opinion.

    在台北有不少家Dreamers，在國父紀念館附近的這家是我的首選。它位置優秀，非常方便前往，尤其是早上七點開始營業這點真的非常適合早鳥們，一大清早總是特別清幽，到中午才會真正忙起來。

    Dreamers國父紀念館店有大片落地窗，陽光得以自然地灑落在室內，有著許多插座的大桌非常適合辦公，當然周邊的小桌也都少不了插座。 WiFi尚可，飲料價位便宜，只是比較少茶類可以選。
