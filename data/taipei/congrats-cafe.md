  en: |
    A relaxing cafe ideal study or work. The first floor is quite narrow and dark. However, head up to the second floor instead, which feels bright and spacious. Plenty of power outlets and the WiFi is extremely fast (300+ Mb/s). There's a large workable, several small table, and a small sofa area. Some of the seats are however not very comfortable (especially the bench seating by the large worktable). Also, there's a smoking room on the 2nd floor and you may notice the smell if someone is using it (normally not a problem though).

    這是一間非常讓人放鬆的咖啡店，適合讀書或工作，一樓也許有些陰暗狹窄，二樓卻非常寬敞明亮，室內有大工作桌和沙發區，傢俱選用很和諧，有很多插座而且WiFi出奇的快（300+ Mb/s)。
    
    有些座位不是那麼舒適（特別是大桌旁的矮座），二樓有個吸菸區所以難免會有煙味（不是太明顯）
