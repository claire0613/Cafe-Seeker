A popular cafe near NTNU. On a weekday afternoon it was very busy full with many people studying or working. It has a cool vibe and good relaxing music selection, but it felt too cramped/crowded. Another downside is that the menu is surprisingly limited (especially if you don't want to drink coffee). The WiFi was very slow and difficult to connect to, and one of the power outlets by my table wasn't working.
