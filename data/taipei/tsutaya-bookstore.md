Great place to sit and get some work done. Be sure to arrive early to get a good seat. There's one large work table with pretty good chairs and power outlets. WiFi is decent. There's a Louisa coffee so you can get drinks and snacks. From the MRT follow the signs to HSR and then take the escalator up two floors.
