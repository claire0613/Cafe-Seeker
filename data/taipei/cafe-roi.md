    A simple cafe near Taipei Arena. The interior and furniture is fairly ordinary, but there are some nice personal touches, like paintings, magazines, and a fish tank. It's clean and the staff was friendly. Decent WiFi, but lacking power outlets. I saw one table near the back wall that has access to power. Nice drinks selection and the food options seem pretty good as well, so it might be a good cafe to have lunch at.

    小巨蛋附近的一家簡潔的咖啡店，裝潢和傢俱都不突出但可以看出一些個人的巧思，像是插畫、雜誌以及一個魚缸，很整潔，店員也很親切。
    
    WiFi很理想，插座稍微少了點，好像只有後方一個座位有插座。飲料選擇很好，食物看起來也不錯，我傍晚時在這裡待了一會兒，但我想這裡也很適合在午餐時間前來吃個便飯再上工。
