    A cozy cafe with nice interior. Quiet in the morning and around lunch on a weekday, but it got quite busy/noisy later during the afternoon between 2pm and 4pm. The WiFi was very fast at first but got quite slow as it filled up. There are lots of power outlets in the first room. The outdoor seats also have a power outlet. However, the second room is lacking power along the right wall seats. The menu is pretty small but has a decent selection of coffee, tea, and non-caffeine drinks. Some food is served, but mostly cakes. There's a 2 hour time limit on weekends.

    漂亮的裝潢、舒適的環境，在Hoto Cafe你可以享有寧靜的早晨直到午餐時間，兩點到四點間會有些繁忙和嘈雜。

    網路ㄧ開始很快但當人開始聚集速度可能就不太理想了。進門的第一個空間有很多插座，甚至戶外座位也有一些，第二個空間的右手邊牆面則無。菜單很簡潔，但備有滿好的飲料選擇，有提供一些蛋糕等輕食。

    週末限時兩小時。
