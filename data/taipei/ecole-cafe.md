    A quirky but cozy cafe with interesting decorations. The inside is quite large with plenty of seating options. I especially like the music selection, which was a mix of soft low-fi, piano, jazz, and instrumental music. The WiFi is great, the food/drinks options are really good (you can have a proper meal here), and the staff was very friendly. There are some drawbacks though. Most of the seats are hard and not very comfortable for extended stays, and some of the larger tables are lacking access to power outlets. In any case, it's nice to spend time here in the morning when it's very quiet, it got a little busy during lunch time though.

    一個妝點得很特別的咖啡店，裡頭空間很大，也有很多座位。我個人偏愛這裡的背景音樂，換搭著soft low-if、鋼琴、爵士以及其他伴奏。 WiFi很棒，食物也很好（你可以在這裡享用正餐），店員非常和善。

    小缺點是大部分的座位可能不適合久坐，大桌不太能搆到插座，不過這裡仍然很適合從早上待到中午，通常很安靜，直到午後才會熱鬧起來。
