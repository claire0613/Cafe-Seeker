    A great place to work near Dazhi north of the Keelung River. The cafe feels very modern with a clean and minimal interior. The second floor is called the "coworking space" and has more seating and large worktables. Both floors are suitable for working and there is no extra fee to use the coworking space (minimum order 1 drink). The first floor was quite busy, even in the morning, but there were plenty of seats available upstairs. Both floors have very comfortable chairs, lots of power outlets, and fast WiFi. Good drink selection and some light food and snacks are available as well.

    基隆河北岸大直區域也有這麼一處適合工作的地方，裝潢簡單輕減。二樓開宗名義直接稱作「co-working space」—共享辦公室—任誰也不會錯用這個場所，座位很多也有適合幾個人一起工作的大辦公桌。其實無論一二樓都很適合遠端工作，有舒服的椅子，充足的插座和快速的WiFi體驗，並沒有額外的使用費（低消一杯飲料）。

    一樓可能比較繁忙，即使是一大早也有不少人，樓上通常有比較多空位。場所提供輕食和足夠的飲料選項。
