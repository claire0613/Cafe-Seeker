    If you're only looking for a great cafe to work from then this is the place. The menu is basic and the interior is not very special. But, the WiFi is fast, there is power *everywhere*, the seats are comfortable, and it's never crowded. It can get a little noisy when people come in for business meetings, but other than that it's usually pretty quiet. I especially like the seats near the back under the skylight. Tip, the restrooms are located on the 2nd floor.

    如果你只是想找一個地方工作，不在意其他外在條件，那麼Next One會是一個很棒的選擇，他們的菜單非常簡單，裝潢也不突出，但卻有非常快的WiFi、舒適的椅子，且每個位置都有插座，幾乎是為了遊牧工作者打造的聖地。

    大部分的時間這裡都不會太多人，只有少數時候有商務會議佔據，我特別喜歡較內側有太陽光透進來的位置。

    Tip:廁所在二樓左手邊。
