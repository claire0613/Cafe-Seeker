A small cafe near Taipei City Hall MRT station. Opens early but closes quite early as well. The seats with the straight seat backs are more comfortable for working. Unfortunately the WiFi was a little slow and music was a little too loud in my opinion. Not really the type of place I'd sit and work for a long time, but definitely good enough for a short morning work session.
