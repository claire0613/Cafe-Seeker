    Decent cafe to sit and work at. When I arrived after lunch it was already very busy, so I guess it's good to arrive early. The second floor is definitely the best place to sit. Plenty of seating areas and lots of natural light. It can be a little noisy at peak times. The food menu is quite extensive but I didn't try any food. Lots of drink options but no regular plain black tea (only milk tea and non-caffeine tea). That was a little disappointing. I tried the chocolate banana shake instead, which was really good though. Fast WiFi and power outlets on the floor.

    上樓看看是間功能性很強的咖啡店，幾乎是為了讀書和工作類型的人打造的。我在午餐時間過後拜訪時這裡還滿熱鬧的，所以我猜可能要早點到比較好，二樓絕對是一個很好的座位區，有很多座位和自然光，尖峰時間可能會有點吵。

    餐點的選擇很多，不過這次我沒有特別點餐，另外一點可惜的是這裡只有奶茶和無咖啡因茶，剛好和我的需要相反，讓我有點小失望。不過我試了香蕉奶昔，這也很好喝唷。
