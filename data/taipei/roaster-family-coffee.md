    A small cafe with an extensive coffee selection, as well as some tea and food. The seating area is small, so if you arrive at a busy time you probably won't get a seat. Morning and late afternoon seem to be less busy. The interior is nice, with chessboard styled tables, and stained glass windows. Friendly staff, comfortable chairs, there are power outlets along the wall, and the WiFi was quite fast and stable. Definitely a comfortable place to work for a couple of hours, but not really suitable for extended stays.

    這是一家空間不大但有很多咖啡和茶飲選擇的咖啡店，座位區基本上不大，在尖峰時段不太容易找到位置，感覺上一大早和傍晚比較空。室內陳設很雅緻，特別是幾張西洋棋面的桌子剛好搭上最近后翼棄兵的熱潮，令人感覺萬分親切，花窗玻璃也是台灣少見的設計，很有故事感。

    這裡也有親切的店員、舒適的座位，牆面也都有插座，WiFi快速且穩定，或許不適合在這裡工作一整天，但只要能找到座位絕對會想待上一陣子。
