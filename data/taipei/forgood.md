A modern cafe, with fast WiFi and a very large and interesting drink selection. Only some seats have access to the power though. The large worktable did not have any power outlets. Also, the music selection was a little strange, and not really to my liking (electronic ambient music). Note that the food portion size is very small (only suitable as a small snack). Time limit of 3 hours might be enforced during busy times.

Update: The WiFi has become much slower
