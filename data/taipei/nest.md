    A good cafe if you're looking to work/study and also have some lunch. The atmosphere feels very relaxing and homey with soft music playing in the background. There's a good choice of both drinks and food. I tried the Japanese curry rice, which was really tasty. The cafe is small and it filled up in the afternoon, so it's good to arrive early!

    如果你在找一個可以吃午餐又能工作、讀書一下的場所，這裡很適合你。背景播送的輕音樂讓室內的氣氛安逸舒適。食物和飲品都很不錯，我點了日式咖喱，非常好吃。這家咖啡廳不大，下午也容易爆滿，建議提早來。
