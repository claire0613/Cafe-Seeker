    A really nice cafe to work from. Good vibe, cozy interior, and normally very quiet. You can sit outside on the balcony (but smoking is allowed there). The entrance is a little difficult to find (the entrance is on the second floor of the building). Staff is friendly and food/drinks are good. Wifi can be very hit or miss. It can be slow and unstable at times, so it's good to have a backup mobile hot spot. Plenty of power outlets. Be sure to arrive early to get a good seat before it fills up. Cash only!

    一個非常適合工作的咖啡，WiFi有時稍微慢了點，但整體來說很不錯，充電座也滿多的。入口不太容易找（在二樓）。店員很親切，也提供了很棒的食物。記得早點來挑你最喜歡的位置，別又看著客滿的店內後悔了 ：） 只收現金！
