    A nice, small cafe near Yongkang Street. The interior feels modern and has a relaxing atmosphere. It was not very busy throughout the day on a weekday. The WiFi is great, and there are some power outlets along the left side wall, but none at the larger table. I would recommend the "Happy Hour" coffee/tea + cake set for 330. Both the tea and the tiramisu that I ordered were good.

    永康街附近有這麼一家小巧可愛的咖啡店，裝潢很現代也很溫馨，平日不怎麼繁忙，WiFi很棒，左面的牆有些插座，我很推薦”Happy Hour”的套餐（咖啡/茶+蛋糕組只要330），茶和提拉米蘇都很不錯。
