    A great cafe to work from on a weekday. Very calm and cozy interior. Relaxing music. Friendly staff. The tea selection is small compared to the coffee selection, but the oolong black tea is really good. There's lots of seating inside, as well as an outdoor area with shade and fans. Good WiFi and power outlets at some seats. My only complaint would be that it would be nice if all the seats had cushions. Starts to get busy around 3pm but usually doesn't get too crowded. There is a large nice outdoor seating area (smoking allowed).

    一個非常適合平日工作的咖啡店，通常三點開始變得熱鬧，但通常不至於太過擁擠，氣氛溫和安靜，音樂令人安心，而店員很親切。茶的選擇略少於咖啡，但烏龍紅茶非常好喝。

    室內座位很多，戶外區很寬敞，有陰涼處也有風扇，可吸菸。WiFi很理想，也有幾個座位有插座。小小的介意是希望所有的位置都有坐墊。

    （很可惜截稿後發現它11/30就結束營業了，有點傷心）
