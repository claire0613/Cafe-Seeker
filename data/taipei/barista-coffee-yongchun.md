    Yongchun Barista Coffee is actually not very special at all, it is just a chain coffee shop. However, I just want to say that chain coffee shops sometimes guarantee a certain level of consistency, just like Starbucks that we all like. The Barista Coffee in Yongchun is located between Houshanpi and Yongchun Station. It mainly serves nearby companies and residents, with a diverse type of clientele throughout the day.

    There is a small room in the back, with one particular seat that I like, and has power. In the past when I had some urgent work, I would choose to retreat here the whole day because you can have a meal, and it’s easy to refill on caffeine. If it’s too stuffy, the bar seats outside by the windows might be a better option.

    WiFi is very good, there are many outlets, various types of seats can meet different needs, and it is also very suitable for group discussions.

    永春西雅圖咖啡其實一點也不特別，它只是連鎖咖啡店的其中一間。只是不得不說，連鎖咖啡店有時候也直接保證了地點、菜單有一定水準，就像我們都喜歡的星巴克。永春這家西雅圖咖啡在後山埤和永春站中間，主要是服務附近公司和居民，從早到晚有著不太一樣的生態系。

    後方還有一處小房間，有個單人座附有插座，這裡在過去常常是我應急用的場所，收到有時間壓力的急案時，我會選擇到這裡閉關，因為有供餐，待上一整天也沒問題，補充咖啡因也很容易，如果有些悶，外頭靠窗的吧檯座位是很能紓壓的空間。

    WiFi很不錯，也有很多插座，各種不同形式的座位可以滿足不同的需求，也很適合小組討論。
