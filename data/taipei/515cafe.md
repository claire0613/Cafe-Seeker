    A quiet and cozy cafe close to Yongkang Street. Relaxed atmosphere good for working or studying. There are counter seats, small tables, and a large worktable (which I think can be reserved). The outdoor seating looks like a good option when the weather is nice. There are two cats that may come up and say hi to you (you can find their names in the menu). The restroom facilities are quite basic.

    515是永康街附近的複合式咖啡店，氣氛總是靜謐祥和，適合讀書工作。這裡有吧台桌、小桌和工作桌（我想大桌應該是能訂位的），戶外座位看起來在天氣好的時候也很舒適。這裡有兩隻熱情的好朋友，可能會來跟你打招呼唷！你還可以看到牠們的名字就寫在菜單上。
