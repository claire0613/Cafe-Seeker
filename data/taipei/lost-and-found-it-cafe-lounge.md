    A great cafe near Zhongxiao Dunhua. Take the entrance up to the second floor. The interior is bright and modern. I particularly like the counter seats by the windows. The WiFi is extremely fast (350 Mb/s) and there are power outlets by some seats. The menu is not really to my taste, but there are some "ok" drink options. Good to arrive early since it tends to fill up in the afternoon.

    忠孝敦化附近的優秀選擇。沿著入口階梯往上走就會抵達寬敞的二樓空間，室內明亮且簡約，我特別喜歡窗台前的位置。WiFi超級快（350Mb/s) 且有很多插座。美中不足的是餐飲沒有很符合我的偏好，但仍有一些飲料可選。建議提早來，下午似乎容易客滿。
