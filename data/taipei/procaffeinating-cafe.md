  en: |
    A small cafe near Nangang Expo. The wooden floors and thoughtful interior gives it a very cozy and homey feel. The seats are comfortable and the counter is good for standing as well. The wifi is good and if you need power then there are lots of outlets hidden under the countertop. The menu selection is perhaps a little small. The tea was good, but quite small considering the price. The best thing about this cafe was that it never got very crowded or noisy throughout the day on a weekday.

    撲囉咖啡是南港展覽館附近的小型咖啡座。木作基調和具有巧思的內裝給人居家休閒的氛圍，座位都很舒適，而吧台也很適合站著工作。WiFi很棒，而如果你需要充電，櫃檯桌下也有很多隱藏插座唷！
    
    這裡的菜單也許稍微簡單了些，不過有提供價格適中的好茶。最棒的是，這裡在平日並不吵，也不至於擁擠，很適合需要靜下心的工作。
