A tiny cafe just around the corner from Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT station. There are just a couple of small tables inside, and the only table available during my visit was a small table tucked into one of the corners. It was fine, but not the best place to sit and try to do some work. In such a small space, it can easily get quite noisy as well, with some people talking and other's chatting on the phone, and people coming and going for take out orders.

I guess working isn't really the point here though. The main highlight here is the cheap drinks and the tasty and Vietnamese banh mi, which makes for a great lunch.
