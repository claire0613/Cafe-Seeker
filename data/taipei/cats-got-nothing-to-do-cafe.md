If you're looking for a relaxing place with nice views in Maokong then this is a great choice, just a short 10 minute walk from the Gondola. The views are fantastic on a nice day. There is WiFi, although it was very slow. No power outlets, and restroom facilities are quite basic. The drinks menu was a little disappointing, the tea choices weren't particularly interesting, which is ironic since Maokong is famous for great tea. Tip: be sure to bring some mosquito/bug spray!
