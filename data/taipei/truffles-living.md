    A quirky name and an odd description ("bar restaurant furniture store"). Despite this, it is in fact very work friendly and definitely worth visiting. The interior is rustic, filled with vintage and antique furniture. The atmosphere is calm, noise level is good, and it doesn't get very crowded throughout the day. The environment is clean and the space is quite large with multiple seating areas, including several large worktables. Most seats near the walls have power outlets. Friendly and very attentive staff. 

    The two main drawbacks are WiFi and price. The WiFi is usually very slow and difficult to use (even for light browsing). I find myself always using a mobile hotspot instead. Food and drinks are definitely on the pricey side. The quality is good, but the value is perhaps a little low. Also, some seats right under the AC can get a little cold.

    這家店有點奇妙，它有著古怪的名字和新奇的註解（酒吧餐廳與家飾店），但絕對是個值得探訪也適合工作的地方：裝潢古樸，陳設典雅，整個空間充滿復古的氛圍。「舒服生活」一般也不怎麼繁忙，噪音水準很低，大多時候非常寧靜。整體很乾淨且寬敞，有不同類型的座位因應不同需求，包含大工作桌，多數靠牆的座位都有插座。店員很殷勤體貼。

    只有兩點稍微令人卻步：WiFi和價格。WiFi很難連上也通常很慢（即使只是簡單瀏覽網頁），我發現我幾乎都需要用手機分享來支援我在筆電上的連線，食物和飲料絕對算是高價的，品質符合價位但CP值可能不這麼高。最後，冷氣口的位置可能有點冷。
