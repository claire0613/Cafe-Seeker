    This cafe has been on my list for a long time after a friend recommended it to me. It's definitely a great place to work. I arrived on a weekday afternoon and it was almost full, only one table available. Even so, it was very quiet since everyone was either working or studying. The interior is quite small, but the space is comfortable and has plenty of natural light. There's a good selection of drinks and cakes, I tried the oolong tea cheesecake, which was very tasty!

    朋友推薦給我的［Angle咖啡］已經在我的清單上很久了，這裏的確很適合工作。我在一個平日的午候前往，抵達時居然已經接近滿座，只剩下一個位置。儘管如此整個空間卻異常的安靜，因為大家都專注在自己的事情上⋯⋯我是說，讀書或工作。

    這裡空間偏小，但有很多舒適的座位，天氣好的時候也有豐富的自然光源照進來，我點了烏龍茶和起司蛋糕，都非常好吃！
