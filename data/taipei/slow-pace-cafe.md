    I recently discovered this cafe one evening while I had some spare time around Zhongxiao Fuxing. It's only a short walk from the station exit. During the evening on a weekday it was very quiet and there was only one other customer. Upon entering the cafe, the owner's dog will greet you with a friendly bark, although he never left the comfort of the sofa (that seems to be his regular spot!)

    The interior feels cozy, comfortable lighting, and good seats. The menu is quite large, with all the usual selection. I ordered earl grey tea, which came in a huge cup. It was good, but since I only had 1 hour to get some work done I wasn't able to finish it unfortunately.

    某天傍晚我在忠孝復興附近的時候剛好有一小段空檔，於是就在這裡找到了「慢步調」(Slow Pace Cafe)，從忠孝復興站一號出口出來只要走一小段時間就能抵達，平日晚上看起來非常悠閒，只有一個客人在這裡。當你走進店裡時，主人的狗狗會很開心的叫著歡迎你，非常可愛，儘管牠寸步不離自己舒服的沙發，看起來那是牠的固定寶座！

    慢步調的室內空間讓人感覺舒適，也有著溫暖的光線和不錯的座位，Menu看上去很充實，有很多常見的飲品可以選。我點了英式草餐茶，是用一個很大的杯子送來的，只可惜當天我只有一個小時的時間待著，沒辦法把它喝完。

    我想我下次還會去看看主人的狗在不在 :)
