    Relaxing atmosphere, with nice background ambient music (both high and low tempo). There are many tables, but most seem to not have access to power. If you need power you should try to get a counter seat. The outdoor seating area is large, and looks like a great option when the weather is nice. Good drinks selection and very reasonable prices! One minor downside might be that most of the chairs are quite hard, and perhaps not very comfortable for extended stays.

    舒適的環境搭配和緩的背景音樂，這裡有很多座位，不過多數看來不太容易找到插座，如果你需要充電，可能需要選擇吧台座位。戶外座位區很大，天氣好的時候應該很不錯，有很多很棒的飲料選擇，價格也很實惠！一個小缺點是大部分的椅子太硬了，不確定是否能久待。
