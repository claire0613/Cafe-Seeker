    A quiet coffee shop near Yongkang Street. This cafe definitely focuses on coffee and their selection is very large. Even so, they also have a good selection of tea. The interior is quite simple, but feels modern and clean, and the seats are comfortable. If you need power you should get one of the tables by the walls.

    我很喜歡這種簡約的風格，木質地板加上黑鐵件使得整個空間顯得時尚卻又不冷冽，椅子特別的舒適，很想買一張回家。這家Cafe非常重視咖啡本身，有非常多選擇，茶也很不錯。如果你需要插座，可以選靠牆的座位。
