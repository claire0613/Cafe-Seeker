    Stayreal is a Taiwanese clothes brand, and across from their shop near Zhongxiao Dunhua they also operate this cafe. On a weekday afternoon the first floor was quite full, however, the basement floor was empty, great for getting some work done. Even though there are no windows downstairs, the interior feels very bright and clean. The seats are comfortable, the WiFi is good, and there are power outlets along the wall. It is not necessary to order a drink, so if you just want to have a snack I would recommend trying the bubble waffles!

    Stayreal是一家台灣潮牌，忠孝敦化店規劃成了複合式咖啡空間。ㄧ般平日下午一樓會很滿，我個人推薦地下室，較寬敞且有不錯的座位適合工作，儘管沒有對外窗，但整體陳設讓人覺得明亮寬敞。椅子舒服、WiFi很好，牆邊也都有插座。這裡沒有規定飲料低消，所以如果你只想要來點吃的，我很推薦他們的雞蛋仔！
