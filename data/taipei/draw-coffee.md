A small cafe near Dongmen station that opens very early on weekdays (7:30). There's a very small seating area on the first floor, and more seats available upstairs. The 2F interior is quite generic though (nothing special), the seats are not very comfortable, there's a refrigerator that makes a lot of noise, and there is no restroom as far as I could tell. At least there is WiFi, plenty of power outlets, decent (cheap) drink selection, and it's clean.
