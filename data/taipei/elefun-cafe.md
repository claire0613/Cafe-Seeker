An interesting cafe with a curious mix of french music and Star Wars decorations. The interior feels modern and spacious with a small seating area downstairs and a much larger seating area on the second floor. Lots of power outlets, but unfortunately none at the large worktables. WiFi was decent, but felt a little slow when it got busier. During the winter months the upstairs area felt quite cold.
