  en: |
    A fairly new co-working space close to Taipei City Hall. The interior is nice and well designed with plenty of natural light. There are several large worktables for flex members. As a flex member you pay a very reasonable price per day that you visit, rather than a fixed monthly fee. Day passes are sold in batches of 10. Tea/coffee is included. Great WiFi and plenty of power outlets. There's also a meeting room, phone booth, and several other seating areas for relaxing and taking phone calls. All the staff members are extremely friendly!

    這是一家位於台北市政府附近、剛成立不久的共享辦公室。裝潢新穎高雅，優秀的窗戶配置讓室內充滿自然光源，空間裡配置著幾張非常適合工作的大工作桌。只要註冊會員並購買以十天為一組的使用券，就能用非常合理的價格使用辦公空間及享用免費的茶和咖啡。和其他需要負擔固定月費及要求簽署長約的共享空間相比，這裡保留了更多的彈性。

    WiFi優秀、充電座充足。另外也提供會議室（需付費）、電話小間及其他休閒座位區，方便con-call和處理外務。所有的服務人員都非常親切和善！
