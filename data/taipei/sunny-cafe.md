    A great work-friendly cafe near Beimen station. The interior feels bright and clean, and the piano converted to a work table is definitely a unique feature. The cafe is quite large with lots of seating options, and on a weekday it wasn't very busy in the morning and early afternoon. The menu is large with lots of drinks, breakfast, brunch, and other food options. The WiFi was fast, but the main drawback would be that most tables did not have access to power.

    Sunny Cafe是北門附近適合工作的一家小店，裝潢看起來乾淨明亮，室內很寬敞，有非常多的座位選擇，平臺鋼琴改造的工作桌特別引人注目。早上直至午餐過後一般都不會太擁擠，菜單上有不少飲料、早餐、早午餐可選，至少不會讓人餓著。Wifi很快，只是最主要的弱點可能還是不太容易找到插座。
