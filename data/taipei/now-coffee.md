    The entrance to this cafe is a little hidden since the front only has a take-out window. The cafe entrance is actually from the side road. There are two floors with seating (the 3rd floor is just an event space).

    Overall I'd say this cafe is great for having a nice lunch and doing some work or study. I would definitely recommend getting a seat on the second floor, which was very quiet, has plenty of natural light, and comfortable seats.

    The menu has many drink options, including some nice Taiwanese tea. For food there are bagels, but the staff asked if I wanted to try the daily special instead, which was korean style chicken and rice. It was really good and filling!

    Be sure to arrive early though. After around 1pm on a weekday it starts to fill up quickly. Also note that there is a 3 hour time-limit during weekends and holidays.

    鬧咖啡Now Cafe的前門是個外帶窗，真正的入口隱藏在側邊比較不起眼，但裡頭其實有三層樓，有兩層樓的座位區，和三樓的展演空間。

    整體來說鬧咖啡是一個很適合午餐並稍微做點工作和讀書的地方，我絕對會推薦上二樓找個位置，這裡是非常安靜的，且有很多自然光和好坐的椅子。

    菜單包含很多飲品，也有許多很棒的台灣茶，餐點則有貝果，不過我拜訪鬧咖啡的時候店員問我要不要試試他們的日常特餐(員工餐)，那天端出的是韓式的春川辣炒雞肉飯，意外的非常合胃口且很能填飽肚子！

    不過請務必提早到，平日下午一點座位就很快地開始被填滿了，假日有三小時的時間限制。
