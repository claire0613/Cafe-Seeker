    This Dreamers location actually feels more like a co-working space than a cafe. Huge spacious interior, with lots of seating areas across two floors. I especially like the counter seats on the second floor overlooking the first floor. As with other Dreamers locations, there are plenty of food and drink options available.

    There are some unfortunate downsides though. The WiFi was basically unusable (extremely slow and unstable) and the restroom facilities are very basic (no soap provided). It's a shame, if it wasn't for these things, this place has the potential to be one of the best work spots in Taipei.

    我常常覺得Dreamers比較像共享辦公室而不是Cafe，幾乎所有分店都有非常寬敞的室內空間以及各種類型的座位供挑選，我特別喜歡坐在二樓靠欄杆的吧檯桌鳥瞰一樓，視野絕佳。和其他分店一樣，內湖店也有許多餐點和飲料。

    可惜的是還是有些不可避的小缺點，WiFi基本上不堪用(非常慢且不穩定)，廁所比較簡單(沒有洗手乳或肥皂)。如果沒有這些，Dreamers 內湖店基本上很有機會角逐台北工作咖啡廳的冠軍。
