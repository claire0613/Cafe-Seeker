    A small cozy cafe. There's supposedly a cat, but I've been here twice and never seen it. Several seating options available but none are particularly comfortable for extended stays due to the hard seats. Friendly staff and students can enjoy a small discount. It gets quite busy and a little noisy (even in the mornings). Even so, it's a great option for those that want to get an early start since they open at 7:30 on weekdays!

    舒適的咖啡店。應該要有隻貓，但到訪兩次都沒看見。座位的選擇很多，不過沒有特別適合久坐的椅子。服務很好，學生可以享有一些優惠。經常性繁忙和吵雜（即使是一大早），不過儘管如此，這裡仍非常適合想要早早開啟一天的人們，因為它平日七點半就開了！
