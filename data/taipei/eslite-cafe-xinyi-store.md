    The cafe inside the Xinyi Eslite department store opens early and closes late, great for those who need to get to work done during off-peak hours. However, the lack of WiFi and power outlets makes this a difficult work spot. Be sure to arrive fully charged and bring a mobile hotspot. At least the interior and views are nice and the seats are comfortable. Food and drinks are a little pricey. You'll need to use one of the street level entrances to access the cafe when the department store is closed.

    信義誠品裡的咖啡永遠在那裡，適合早出晚歸，又需要在下班尖峰時刻快速把工作完成的你。如果誠品百貨樓層已經關閉，則無法從捷運地下層入口進入，需要從二十四小時開啟的一樓入口進入。有點可惜的是這裡並沒有良好的WiFi和充電座，我們需要帶充飽電的器材並依賴手機吃到飽，不過這可以換來舒適的座位和在典雅空間裡工作的閒適感，值得！（餐飲價格略為昂貴）
