    Recently I've been exploring more of the Zhongshan area in Taipei, and have found many nice cafes to work from around there. Nichi Nichi is definitely a good option if you're looking for a relaxing and quiet place to work in the afternoon, or even late into the night since they stay open until 10pm. The style is minimal and simple, but there are some nice personal touches, like the colorful hanging lamps and decorations on the walls. The soft piano/jazz background music also helps set the mood.

    There's good wifi and power outlets - but be sure to arrive early if you need to charge since only some seats have access to power. The menu selection is also quite small, but the options are good. One drawback for me is that the only tea on the menu is non-caffeine, but anyways, the mint tea was very good. Be sure to try the cakes as well, the banana cake was great!

    最近我開始探訪中山區，也找到了不少適合工作的咖啡廳。Nichi Nichi是一個很放鬆和安靜的地方，很適合下午和晚上來，可以一路待到晚上十點。這裡的風格很簡約，但依然可以找到一些店主的個人風格，例如彩色的吊燈，以及牆面的裝飾等等。店內的輕鋼琴及爵士音樂特別能安穩心情。

    這裡也有很好的Wifi，只是需要插座時要早點來，只有少數座位有。Nichi Nichi的餐點選擇比較少，但都很不錯，記得試試他們的蛋糕，香蕉蛋糕非常好吃! 

    對我來說Nichi Nichi只有一個小缺點，那就是這裡唯一的茶品薄荷茶不含咖啡因，對早上想喝茶來提振精神的我來說有點不方便，晚上來可以點，助眠:)
