    Not only is this a very work-friendly place, but the food is also fantastic, with many great choices and large portions. If you're looking for a place where you can sit and work all day without going somewhere else to get food, then this is definitely your place! It can get pretty busy though, so arrive before or after the weekday lunch rush to make sure you get a good seat.

    The interior is very large with seating available on two floors. The large workable in the middle is quite comfortable. There are power outlets at nearly every seat (even in the floor under the large work table). However, the WiFi was extremely slow, so you'll probably need to use a mobile hotspot if you need reliable internet.

    不僅滿足周邊科技業洽公、行動辦公室的需求，覺旅也提供了豐富的餐飲選擇，如果你是在找一個地方可以紮紮實實待一整天又不用為了午餐而移動，你一定會喜歡覺旅。不過正因爲它的定位是如此合大家的意，想在中午前佔到喜歡的位置並不容易，中午開始就有許多進來開午餐會議的人潮，記得提早來。

    這裡有很寬敞的挑高空間及樓中樓，工作桌非常舒適，也能輕易找到插座，其餘座位也幾乎都有插座，不過網路可能是一大缺點，Wifi非常慢，如果你的工作需要網路，可能要使用手機網路分享，會有點不便。
