Tucked away on the 2nd floor of this art supply shop you'll find a perfect cafe for quiet work or study. Not only is the space quiet and comfortable, it's also worth trying the surprisingly tasty beef curry, which is very reasonably priced, including a drink and a small dessert as well.

On a nice day you can also enjoy the outdoor seating on the balcony. I guess the only minor fault I could find was the lack of power outlets (which from what I could tell, all tables don't have access to). Other than that, it's definitely a great place!

*Note that the shop opens at 10:30, but the cafe opens at 11:00*
