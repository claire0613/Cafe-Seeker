  en: |
    A large modern cafe with lots of seating space. The front area is open and airy, with plenty of natural light. Further inside there are small tables, and two large worktables as well. A large selection of food and drink, good WiFi, and plenty of power outlets makes this a great spot to work from. The sandwiches are worth trying, but the portion was perhaps slightly too small. The chairs aren't the most comfortable and it got a little noisy in the afternoon. Great service and friendly staff.

    我們可以簡單為All Day Roasting Company簡單寫下幾個關鍵字：時尚、寬敞、工業風。這裡有不少位置可選，前半段開放通風，有豐沛的自然光，稍微往裡頭走則可以看到幾張小桌子和兩張大工作桌。食物和飲料的選擇應有盡有，優秀的WiFi和許多插座讓這裡成為極佳的工作環境。

    三明治很值得一試，儘管份量可能有點少。我會說這裡的椅子也許不是最舒適的，且下午開始會有些嘈雜，但美好的服務和貼心的員工掩蓋了這一切。
